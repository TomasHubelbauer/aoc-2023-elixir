# Advent of Code 2023 - Elixir

I am doing Advent of Code this year.
I have chosen the Elixir programming language for this challenge.

## Elixir Setup

I am using macOS and I have installed Elixir using Homebrew:
`brew install elixir`.

I can now run `iex` to drop into the interactive Elixir shell.

Additionally, I can create `.ex` and `.exs` files and run them using the Elixis
compiler CLI. See `elixir 00.exs` for a simple Hello World example.

I am using VS Code to author the files and the Integrated Terminal to run the
Elixir CLI.

I am also using the ElixirLS VS Code extension for an Elixir language server
providing syntax highlighting and auto-completion.
