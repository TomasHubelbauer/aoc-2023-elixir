# 03

I had a false start at first with a more complex solution.
I didn't realize I didn't need to attribute the serials to the engine part
symbols.

I retried again in the second version for a cleaner approach.

I came up with an idea for how to do this even better so I captured it in a
scratch file for a third version, but didn't implement it.

In a surprising twist, being able to associate the parts with their serials
turned out to be key for a part two of the exercise, so this worked out nicely
in the end.

The third solution I have in mind should still be able to provide a solution to
both parts though and be more efficient.
