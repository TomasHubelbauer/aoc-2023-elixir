# 03

I had a false start at first with a more complex solution.
I didn't realize I didn't need to attribute the serials to the engine part
symbols.

I retried again in the second version for a cleaner approach.

I came up with an idea for how to do this even better so I captured it in a
scratch file for a third version, but didn't implement it.
